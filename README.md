# Diceware booklet

For some reason I've decided to create a booklet with all diceware wordlist for
myself.

Diceware is a method for choosing good and secure passwords.
Since people are bad at choosing random things, this method was created.
You simply just throw a die five times, write down the values and then check the
list to find a mathcing word.
Five words are enough to make very strong password suitable for something like
gpg key passphrase.
More words you choose - more enthropy gains your password.

This booklet is based not on
[original diceware by Arnold G. Reinhold](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
but on newer one by Electronic Frontier Foundation.
It's not that it's more secure, but the words are just a little bit longer and
distinctive.

## How to use this pdf

I know that hard-coding(?) page layout is a bad thing to do and I know that there
is probably some specialized software to do this brochure page order, but I have
not found anything more or less useful. Source was made using LibreOffice Draw.

To make a booklet you have to print firstly odd pages, then turn the sheets and
print the even ones. Of cource, if your printer is capable of printing on both
sides you're good.
Then you should cut the page in a half horizontally, fold the lower part behind
the upper, turning it upside down and, finally, binding everything in a desired
way. For this purpose you can use stapler or sewing machine.
