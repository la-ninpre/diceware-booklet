# Diceware booklet

For some reason I've decided to create a booklet with all diceware wordlist for
myself.

Diceware is a method for choosing good and secure passwords.
Since people are bad at choosing random things, this method was created.
You simply just throw a die five times, write down the values and then check the
list to find a mathcing word.
Five words are enough to make very strong password suitable for something like
gpg key passphrase.
More words you choose - more enthropy gains your password.

This booklet is based not on
[original diceware by Arnold G. Reinhold](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)
but on newer one by Electronic Frontier Foundation.
It's not that it's more secure, but the words are just a little bit longer and
distinctive.
